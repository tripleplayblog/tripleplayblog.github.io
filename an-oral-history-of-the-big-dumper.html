  <h1>An Oral History of the Big Dumper</h1>
  <h3>By: Donnie Picciolo on 8/5/2025</h3>
  <!-- paragraphs in <p></p> -->
  <p>CKershaw: Yah, I struck him out in the 2025 ASG. It's one of the few post-season accomplishments that I think will stick to me and probably will get mentioned when he is inducted into the HOF someday.</p>
  <p>JKelenic: I came up with the name "Big Dumper." Likely it'll be the only think I'll end up being known for when I retire.</p>
  <p>CRaleigh: At first I didn't like the nickname. I mean it refers to my butt. But now I like it and have it on my catching gear for example.</p>
  <p>AJudge: He has more homeruns than I do at the All-Star Break. Dude has some serious power. I hope he's a Yankee someday soon.</p>
  <p>CRaleigh (again): Say it in the pamp, in the wamp, I'm the champ. I'm the home run derby champ.</p>
  <p>Will Smith: I'd have said I'm the best hitting catcher. Except for Cal.</p>
  <p>CRaleigh (again): [about the M's front office]: We've got to commit to winning, we have to commit to going and getting those players you see other teams going out and getting.</p>
  <p>Deflate gate participant Tom Brady: I would have been a good catcher, but nothing like the dumper.</p>
  <p>CRaleigh (again): My enormous butt is both a blessing and a curse. </p>
  <p>Altuve: At least HE is not a cheater.</p>
  <p>CRaleigh (again): You've got to believe in yourself.</p>
  <p>The Big Amish: That's not my real nickname, but Cal's is kindof important.</p>
